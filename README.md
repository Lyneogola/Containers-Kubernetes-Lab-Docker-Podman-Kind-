# Containers & Kubernetes Lab (Docker, Podman, Kind)
This lab provides hands-on experience with containerization and orchestration using Docker, Podman, and Kubernetes. It begins with installing Docker, exploring core container lifecycle operations, and building images with Dockerfiles. Docker is then uninstalled and replaced with Podman to demonstrate a rootless, Docker-compatible workflow. Finally, a Kubernetes cluster is set up with Kind, a lightweight tool for running Kubernetes locally.
# Pre-Requisites
